# AECLogger
Control and log AEConversion photovoltaik microinverters with PLC/HS485 protocol per web-interface based on mini-linux boards like RapberryPI / Cubieboards / Odroids ...

The program is in no way associated with AEConversion, programmlogic handling the RS485 protocol  is based on re-engineering the Java-Application (AESolar) from AEConversion. There is absolutely no support from AEConversion regarding AECLogger.

These Microinverters are mainly sold in german-speaking areas so the Wiki-description is done in german.
