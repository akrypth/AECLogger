# AECLogger
Control and log AEConversion photovoltaik microinverters with PLC/HS485 protocol per web-interface based on mini-linux boards like RapberryPI / Cubieboards / Odroids ...

<b>The program is in no way associated with AEConversion.<br>
The program-logic handling the RS485 protocol  is based on re-engineering the Java-Application (AESolar) from AEConversion. There is absolutely no support from AEConversion regarding AECLogger.</b>

These Microinverters are mainly sold in german-speaking areas so the Wiki-description is done in german.
